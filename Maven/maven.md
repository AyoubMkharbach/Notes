# Maven LifeCycle

> What `${clean}` does (common in both the commands) - removes all files generated by the previous build

These are the default life cycle phases in maven

  - `validate` - validate the project is correct and all necessary information is available
  - `compile` - compile the source code of the project 
  - `test` - test the compiled source code using a suitable unit testing framework. These tests should not require the code be packaged or deployed 
  - `package` - take the compiled code and package it in its distributable format, such as a JAR. 
  - `verify` - run any checks on results of integration tests to ensure quality criteria are met 
  - `install` - install the package into the local repository, for use as a dependency in other projects locally 
  - `deploy` - done in the build environment, copies the final package to the remote repository for sharing with other developers and projects. 
 
 How Maven works is, if you run a command for any of the lifecycle phases, it executes each default life cycle phase in order, before executing the command itself.

**Order of execution :**
1. validate 
2. compile 
3. test (optional) 
4. package  
5. verify
6. install
7. deploy

So when you run the command mvn package, it runs the commands for all lifecycle phases till package

validate >> compile >> test (optional) >> package

And as for mvn install, it runs the commands for all lifecycle phases till install, which includes package as well

So, effectively what it means is, install commands does everything that package command does and some more (install the package into the local repository, for use as a dependency in other projects locally)
